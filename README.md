# dotfiles

## Introduction

This repository is for my self-maintained dotfiles to facilitate my future dev and work.

I am using [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) (a dotfile manager) to manage dotfiles.

> As I have installed several third-party frameworks, tools, and plugins, some dotfiles may not work directly.

This respository is only a backup currently. In the future, I will consider to improve it to a useful reference for every developers, just like other famous dotfile repositories.
