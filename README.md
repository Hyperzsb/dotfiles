# dotfiles

This repository is for my self-maintained dotfiles to facilitate my future dev and work.

> As I have installed several third-party frameworks, tools, and plugins, some dotfiles may not work directly.

This respository is only a backup currently. In the future, I will consider to improve it to a useful reference for every developers, just like other famous dotfile repositories.

## Third-Party Tools

I have tried to use [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) and [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) to manage dotfiles. Although they provide tons of functions, they can hardly cover my requirements. 

> However, I still recommend everyone to use these tools, as they may be just suitable for you, or they can provide general philosophy of managing dotfiles.

As a result, I manage dotfiles manually at present, and I may try to use some scripts to make the management automatic.
